# Description

Flight of Vanity is a puzzle-platformer where players will work to solve intricate levels in a beautiful, mystical world that can be viewed from six different perspectivesâ€“six sides of one cube. With the manipulation of light and mirrors across the 3D cube world serving as our core mechanic, the game will challenge players to find ways to redirect light in creative ways to move on to the next stage. Sometimes, certain ledges in the starting side of the cube may only be reachable by dropping in from the top side. Other times, the keyhole may be right next to players, but they must reflect light from a mirror on the opposite side of the cube to open it. Solving the level will require traversal and manipulation of obstacles and mirrors across all sides of the cube, and objects on different faces will often have to interact with each other for players to achieve victory.

Players will play as Vanity, the eighth deadly sin inspired by Narcissus from Greek mythology. Born in the dark underground world, Vanity hungers to climb upwards and dominate the unsuspecting world above. To do so, Vanity must conquer seven treacherous floors, each ruled by one of the seven deadly sins, manipulating the essence of light itself with the aid of mirrors to ascend ever higher.
